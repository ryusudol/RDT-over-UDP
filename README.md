# Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) protocols over User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

- Implementation of RDT protocols over UDP, combining UDP’s speed with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)’s reliability.
- Developed data integrity mechanisms with checksums and sequence numbers; devised timeout and retransmission strategies to address packet loss.
- Achieved **99%** reliability in data transmission under simulated network conditions.
